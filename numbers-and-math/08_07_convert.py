# Demonstrate how to:
# -------------------
# 1) Convert an int to a float
# 2) Convert a float to an int
# 3) Perform division using a float and an int.
# 4) Use two variables to perform a multiplication.
#
# What information is lost during which conversions? all of the decimal parts of the number

# 1) 
num1 = 10
num1 = float(num1)

# 2) 
num2 = 7.2
num2 = int(num2)

# 3)
num3 = num2/num1

# 4)
num4 = num1*num2
